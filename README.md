Headline Inticators for Firefox
===============================

This project contains the ETL that produces the required data for the
**HIF dashboard**.


The parameters that specify the current and previous versions of Firefox are
populated using the `fx_versions.txt` file.  It should contain the latest
version on line 1, the previous version on line 2, and so on.
